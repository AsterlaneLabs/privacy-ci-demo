    | Erasure lifecycle

    | rather than erasing anything immediately. Signing back in, or calling
    | cancelDeletion(), calls it off. Once the window closes, the scheduled
    | command erases them.
    |
    | There is no undo, so the window is the safety mechanism. Setting
    | grace_days to 0 erases on the next scheduler tick, so set it knowingly.
    |
    | GDPR Art. 12(3) expects a response without undue delay and within one
    | month. Suspending on day zero means the request is substantively honoured
    | immediately, and the window is then only a recovery period for the data,
    | which is why the default is 14 days of suspension rather than 30 of
    | nothing. Window length and mode are linked: a long window without
    | suspension is the weakest posture available.
